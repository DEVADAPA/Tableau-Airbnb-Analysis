## 1. Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze AirBnB listing data to identify pricing trends, property distribution, and key factors influencing host success.

This dashboard answers key business questions, such as:
* What is the average price per night based on neighborhood or room type?
* Where are the most popular listings concentrated?
* What are the top 5 most expensive zipcodes in our market?
* Did our revenue grow consistently, or were there specific periods of high growth?
* What is our most common listing type (in terms of bedroom count)?

## 2. Data Source
The data was a `.csv` file containing 3815 rows of AirBnB listings. The data included fields like `neighbourhood`, `room_type`, `price`, `zipcode`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and `number_of_reviews`.

Data was cleaned in Excel to remove null values and standardize room_type entries.
